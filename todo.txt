possible Bias?
    Done- No always predict the last node

get more info
    mail other papers writers - how they do the online predict - does it always on the last node as well ?
    check other papers evaluations - do they add info about how they generate seq data, how they test and evaluate ?

Time OF run
    Check with Bracha = possibility to get a machine with GPU/ how to run with GPU ?
    Tool long even on yoochoose 1/64
    ? Run yoochoose with TS vs pytorch - time f Run ; Problem - TF dees not run
    Consider less epoches then the default ; default --epoch 30
    get diginetica - prepare and run

Add improvement
    Check where the tested node is selected -  data Preparation - or test
    add the nodes in the train
    add an option to OK EOS node in teh validation
    how to compare results
        check that we have the same error on test w/o last click ?
        test on all data, and add constant error for the last click when running w/o improvement ?
    Where to add the new items ?
        in train only  ?
        in teest and train ?

general dev
    Add print to file
    make TF run

to understand
    What is the loss vs the recall and the mmr
